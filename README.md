# 👋 Hi, I'm Anna — Data Scientist  
**Python • GIS • Insurance & Real Estate Analytics**  
*From spatial data to business-ready insights.*

I’m a Data Scientist focused on turning complex spatial, demographic, and insurance datasets into **clear insights, predictive models, and decision-ready tools**. My work spans **geospatial analytics, risk modeling, housing/market analysis, and large-scale data integration**.

I enjoy building end-to-end workflows — from data ingestion and feature engineering to modeling, visualization, and narrative insights.

## 🔍 What I Do
- **Geospatial & Risk Modeling**  
  Earthquake exposure, fault-line metrics, housing vulnerability, insurance coverage gaps.

- **Predictive Analytics & ML**  
  XGBoost, scikit-learn, SHAP explainability, forecasting, risk scoring.

- **Market & Real Estate Analytics**  
  Market trends, housing pricing, DOM analysis, property data scraping.

- **Visualization & BI**  
  Tableau dashboards, Folium maps, geospatial plots, exploratory analysis.

- **Data Engineering Lite**  
  ETL pipelines, API integrations (USGS, Census), automated data workflows.
